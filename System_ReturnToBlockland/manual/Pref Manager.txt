<font:Palatino Linotype:24>Pref Manager<font:Palatino Linotype:18>
RTB will be including a preference manager which will be accessible to Super Admins on the server. Any add-on can register prefs to be managed by this using the following function:

<font:Palatino Linotype Bold:18>RTB_registerPref("Pref Name","Category","Pref","Var Type","Your Mod Name","Default Pref Value","Requires Server Restart");

<font:Palatino Linotype:18>The first parameter is for a standard tip, and you can use <key:bindname> in your tip to display a bind. In the event that the key is unbound the no-bind tip will be displayed (and if you don't have one of those, it will move onto the next tip)

Here is some example code you could put into your server.cs file of your Add-On:

<font:Courier New:14>if(isFile("Add-Ons/System_ReturnToBlockland/server.cs"))
{
   if(!$RTB::RTBR_ServerControl_Hook)
      exec("Add-Ons/System_ReturnToBlockland/RTBR_ServerControl_Hook.cs");
   RTB_registerPref("Duplicator Timeout","Duplicator","Duplicator::Timeout","int 0 60","Tool_Duplicator",40,0);
}
else
{
   $Duplicator::Timeout = 40;
}

<font:Palatino Linotype:18>This would register a pref titled "Duplicator Timeout" under the Duplicator category, to edit the $Duplicator::Timeout variable, and allowing the user to enter an integer between 0 and 60. The mod name parameter is only for tracking what mods created what prefs, the default value is for setting a default value for the preference, and the last pref will show whether the server needs to be restarted or not for the pref to take effect.

<font:Palatino Linotype Bold:18>This code must be put into the server.cs NOT the client.cs
